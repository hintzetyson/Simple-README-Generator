# Simple README Generator

[![repo size](https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/hockeyduck3/Simple-README-Generator)](https://github.com/hockeyduck3/Simple-README-Generator)

## Description

This project was an assignment for my Full-Stack web development course. It was designed to make simple README files, this README was made using the code from this repo as well! I'm using [inquirer npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for the questions, [axios npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) for the api call, and the rest is just regular Javascript. I do hope to come back to this project and make it even better in the future!
